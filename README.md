XBMC Vodafone Plugin
=======================

About
-----

The XBMC Vodafone Plugin integrates live TV streaming via Vodafone's IPTV service into XBMC. This plugin is useful for occasional live TV viewing. If you require power features like time shift viewing or recording, you should consider installing a TV backend server like tvheadend, vdf or dvbviewer. It allows to view all german public channels (Ã–ffentlich-Rechtliche Sender) and some of the commercial channels (RTL Group) in XBMC.

Prerequisites
-----
You need a german DSL/VDSL Vodafone TV contract from Vodafone and a router supporting IPTV via multicast proxying in order to use this service (you have one, if you use the one you got from Vodafone)! See http://www.vodafone.de/
